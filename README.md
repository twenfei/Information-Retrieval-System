How to run the "Interactive" section

1. Run "Installing ChatGPT". You will be prompted to enter your password and email for OpenAI. Restart the runtime after installation once the installation is successful, otherwise it cannot import the packages properly.

2. Run "Load and Preprocess Action-Effect Data" and "Indexing action-effect dataset". Please DON'T RERUN "Improved Models". It might cause unwanted behavior.

3. Run "Interactive" part. If everything above runs successfully, you should be able to the retrievd results.

NOTE: Unfortunately, I cannot test out the Interactive part since my OpenAI account cannot make any more requests (they may already limit my account or they disable such Web API requests). But the overall pipeline should work well assuming the API request is successful. I ran the experiments right after ChatGPT came out so at that time it works perfectly well, and you can check the notebook output for evidence. Honestly, I do not know what OpenAI does with their API at this time, and I cannot test it out with my own account.
